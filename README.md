# Complex Activity Recognition
Course Project Repo for UCLA C247 (Neural Networks and Deep Learning - Prof. J.C. Kao) based on Cooking Activity Challenge 2020 (https://abc-research.github.io/cook2020/)

The goal of the ”Cooking Activity Recognition Challenge” is to classify three macro human activities and the constituent isolated sequences of micro-activities (multilabel classification) from inertial and motion capture sensors with varying sampling rates and missing data. In this paper, we benchmark the performance of deep convolutional bidirectional long short-term memory (DCBL) architecture, along with LSTM and convolutional neural network (CNN) for complex activity recognition with missing, misaligned and differently sampled data. For macro-activities, DCBL achieved the highest validation accuracy of 80.1% while for micro-activities, the same architecture achieved 50.3% validation accuracy, outperforming vanilla CNN and LSTM. The low classification accuracy in the later case can be attributed to a large portion of essential event windows lacking sample points and appropriate lengths, as well as the training dataset being too small for multi-label microactivity training.
